/**
 * mention-clone.ts — start a mentioned agent through a clone of this
 * conversation, without putting anything in the chat.
 *
 * Claude Code routes `@agent-<type>` through the main model: the mention
 * becomes a `<system-reminder>` appended to the prompt and the model makes the
 * tool call (see `agentMentionReminder`). That buys the spawned agent a prompt
 * written with conversation context, and costs a visible turn — the model's
 * reasoning and its tool block land in the transcript, for a decision the user
 * already made when they typed the handle.
 *
 * So the turn happens somewhere else. The conversation is cloned into a
 * throwaway in-memory session — same messages, same system prompt, same model —
 * and that copy takes the turn off-screen. A literal clone: the session's own
 * entries, projected by Pi's own context APIs, not
 * `inherit_context`'s text rendering of them.
 *
 * Cloned from memory rather than from the session file, which cannot be relied
 * on before the conversation has been persisted.
 * Copying the active branch has no such timing. Newer Pi managers accept those
 * entries and apply compaction summaries and context edits themselves. Older
 * Pi restores projected messages into agent state instead. An empty conversation
 * simply has no history to restore.
 *
 * The parent's live thinking level takes precedence over copied history.
 * When unavailable, Pi resolves it from seeded history or settings.
 *
 * Three details make the spawn belong to the real session rather than the
 * clone:
 *
 *   - the clone is handed the *registered* `Agent` tool, whose handler closes
 *     over the main activation, so it spawns top-level: widget, fleet row,
 *     handle, completion notification, all as if the main model had called it;
 *   - that tool is re-bound to the main `ExtensionContext`, because the handler
 *     reads `cwd`, `model` and `sessionManager.getSessionId()` off it to place
 *     the transcript and the `rootSessionId`. The clone's own context would
 *     file both under the throwaway fork;
 *   - it is called with no tool-call id. The clone's turn produces one, but the
 *     real session never issued it, and a `<tool-use-id>` pointing at nothing
 *     is exactly the bug the mention-resume path had to fix;
 *   - and it is forced into the background. A foreground agent returns its
 *     answer as the tool result and is marked `resultConsumed` so no completion
 *     notification is sent — correct when the caller is the real conversation,
 *     silent loss when the caller is a fork about to be discarded. Background
 *     delivery is the only route from a mention back to the main model.
 *
 * The clone gets one tool and one job. It cannot read, write or run anything —
 * an invisible turn with the full toolset could do invisible work.
